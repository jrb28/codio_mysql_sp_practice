The exercises are sequenced in order of increasing complexity.  The SQL code that you write within the stored procedures follows this sequence:

- Basic <code>SELECT</code> queries from one table with no conditions
- <code>SELECT</code> queries with hard-coded conditions
- <code>SELECT</code> queries with conditions and input parameters

It is __VERY important that your stored procedures have the exact name (including proper case) as is specified in each exercise__ or your work will not be checked correctly.

Please refer to your class notes and class session recordings for the introduction to creating stored procedures in each of the categories below.
